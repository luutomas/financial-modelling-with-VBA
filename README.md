# Project VBA
## Scope: 
Following the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) initation, we are devising a calculator that will extract data using macros in order to evaluate the given situation

## Output:
An output visualization showing
1. which age this retirement would be possible 
2. given how much the expenses will be desired (inflation adjustment?, present value adjustment?)
3. given how much the monthly/yearly investment
4. graphs depicting the process of the portfolio getting depreciated etc.

## Input: 
1. Desired Monthly modest expense at the given time
2. Retiring Age OR Monthly investment
3. Extracting S&P, other index funds yield in the last 10-20 years (hopefully there will be data)
4. Extracting Bond yields
5. Extracting past inflations

## To-do: 
1. Makro Extractor for S&P
2. Makro Extractor for Bond Yields
3. Makro Extractor for past inflations
4. Devising the formula for the portfolio value at the certain point
5. Devising the interface for the formula to detect which cells are blank with no info (ALWAYS needed to have at least two information)
