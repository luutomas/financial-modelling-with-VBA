# Project VBA
## Scope: 
Following the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) initation, we are devising a calculator that will extract data using macros in order to evaluate the given situation

## Output:
An output visualization showing
1. which age this retirement would be possible 
2. given how much the expenses will be desired (inflation adjustment?, present value adjustment?)
3. given how much the monthly/yearly investment
4. graphs depicting the process of the portfolio getting depreciated etc.

## Input: 
1. Desired Monthly modest expense at the given time
2. Retiring Age OR Monthly investment
3. Extracting S&P, other index funds yield in the last 10-20 years (hopefully there will be data)
4. Extracting Bond yields
5. Extracting past inflations

## To-do: 
1. Makro Extractor for S&P
2. Makro Extractor for Bond Yields
3. Makro Extractor for past inflations

## To-do for simpler version: 
1. Calculate how much money to invest given the other parameters

## To-do for advanced version: 
1. Function: How much money to invest given the other parameters
2. Function: What is the year of retirement given the other parameters
3. Function: How much money can I spend in retirement given the other parameters
4. Function: How many years can I spend in retirement given the other parameters
5. Case function or input formula? Choose what to calculate => THE BEST VERSION => Evaluate the inputs and its possibility and give all above function one scenario
